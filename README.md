# hello-world

Did you ever sit and ponder
as you walked along the Strand
That life's a bitter battle at its best.
That if you only knew it and would lend a helping hand
Then every man could meet his final test.
The world is but a stage; my Friend.
And life is but a game.
And how you play is all that matters in the end.
'Cause it takes a heap of lovin' to make a home like that
on the road to where the flying fishes play.
